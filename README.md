Record Shop API Project
>
This project is a RESTful backend API for a record shop built using Java, Maven and Spring Boot (version 3.3.3). It had been designed to allow a Record Shop Employee to store and update information about albums, as well as query the data in various ways in order to retrieve filtered album results.

>
To run this project you will require:
1) An IDE (Integrated Development Environment), such as IntelliJ IDEA
2) Java 21
3) A RDBMS (Relational Database Management System), such as Postgres

It is also recommended to have software such as Postman or pgAdmin in order to be able to check stored data.

For security there are no included application.properties files included in the repository, these will need to be manually created within the resources package with the relevant RDBMS configuration information.
